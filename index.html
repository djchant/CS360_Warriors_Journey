	<h2>This is a test</h2>

	<!-- <a href = "">Bar Chart</a> -->

	<p>After their half-decade dominance, the Golden State Warriors have firmly cemented their claim as one of the best franchises in the history of the NBA. 3-pointer by 3-pointer, record by record. From drafting the perfect trio of players who will revolutionize the game to consistently shattering expectations. The fashion in which the Warriors dominated the league is quite unparalleled. </p>
	<p>Aside from the “Run-TMC” and “We Believe” teams, the Warriors have spent the majority of their time in the Bay Area as a mediocre team, having only one championship win in 1975. Towards the end of the “We Believe” era, the Warriors selected Stephen Curry with the 7th pick in the 2009 NBA draft. There were mixed opinions on Curry coming into the league. He was considered a scrawny player compared to everyone else because he wasn’t the tallest nor the most athletic player. However, he showcased his unique ability to shoot the basketball during the 2008 March Madness, which not many people have seen before. The big question was how would Curry hold up with the physicality of the league and would he be able to transfer the crazy things he was able to do in college into the league. It also didn’t help that Curry had unusually fragile ankles, leading to extended time missed during the early stages of his career. </p>
	<p>Next, enter Klay Thompson and Draymond Green in the 2011 NBA draft as the 11th pick and the 2012 NBA draft as the 38th pick, respectively. Thompson was also known for his shooting but many had their doubts on whether either Thompson or Curry could play defense. Green was not chosen in the first round, suggesting that he was seen more as a backup player. He was known as a player who can do it all, from rebounds to assists to defense to making a few three pointers. What wasn’t known was that Thompson would develop into a great defender as well and Green would break out, win multiple NBA awards, and change the way his position is played. </p>
	<p>The team’s success began trending upwards starting in 2011 as these various pieces started coming together. In both the 2014-2015 and the 2015-2016 seasons, the Warriors shattered all expectations, broke all types of records, and went to the Finals twice, only managing to win one. Green became the team’s swiss-army knife, allowing Curry and Thompson to not be as responsible for facilitating the ball, while also taking on the responsibilities of a traditional center but playing at a much faster pace due to his speed. Curry and Thompson broke all three-point records and are now only competing against each other. Some notable individual achievements include Curry’s two MVP awards and the trio’s all-star and all-nba selections. In the first season, the Warriors winning the championship showed everyone in the world that you can win without being incredibly athletic or naturally big and strong. It was an inspiration to all that anyone of any size can make it to the top of the NBA as long as they work hard to perfect their skills.  In the second season of the two, the Warriors broke the all-time record set by the great Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls by winning 73 games out of 82 which the Bulls only won 72. Unfortunately the Warriors were unable to finish the job, losing in the Finals to LeBron James. </p>
	<p>In that very offseason, the Warriors, namely, Curry, Thompson, Green, and Andre Iguodala, traveled to recruit a certain Kevin Durant to join the Warriors. Keep in mind, in the years prior to the emergence of the Warriors, Durant had a small rivalry with LeBron on who would be the best player in the league. LeBron and Durant finished top two in MVP voting in 3 consecutive seasons before Curry won his first. Arguably the top 3 players in the summer of 2016 were LeBron, Durant, and Curry. The Warriors have just snagged Kevin Durant from the Oklahoma City Thunder to go join Curry and the Warriors who have just won 73 games in the prior season. Many people were upset, many people were disgusted, instantly transforming the Warriors into the villains of the league. To Warriors fans? This was a dream, that no one ever even dreamt because no one thought it was possible, come true. </p>
	<p>Kevin Durant fit seamlessly into the Warriors system in the first two years of his stay with the Warriors. Durant’s shooting skills, natural build, and speed made him fit perfectly alongside Curry and Thompson. The Warriors breezed through the competition even as Durant was still learning the system. In the playoffs of 2017, the Warriors went undefeated throughout the playoffs and only lost one game when they once again went up against LeBron James in the Finals. It was the same result the next year, however the team didn’t do too well in the regular season when Curry hurt his knee. Heading into the playoffs of 2018, the Warriors won each of their first two rounds in 5 games. The only competition that everyone looked forward to was the matchup against the Houston Rockets, who managed to take the Warriors to a Game 7. But after the Rockets, everything went as expected. The Warriors easily beat LeBron James in 4 games to win their back to back championship. </p>
	<p>It might be a bit ambitious to say the fall of the dynasty started in the beginning of Durant’s third year with the Warriors. But during just another regular season game against the LA Clippers, Green and Durant had a big argument that led to Green confronting Durant about. not seemingly wanting to commit long term to the Warriors, signing two short term deals in the two years he was with the Warriors. This attack most definitely hurt the team chemistry and it was clear that Durant was frustrated with some aspects of the team. The Warriors chugged along the rest of the season into the playoffs where they got by due to the sheer amount of talent on the team. With a third Finals appearance in a row, the Warriors are now in prime position to complete a three-peat, another feat only a few teams have done before. The most obvious fall of the dynasty all happened within a span of a few months. The amount of suspense and heartbreak in this series was quite unprecedented. In the 2019 Finals against the newcomers, Kawhi Leonard and the Toronto Raptors, Thompson and Durant were both lost to season ending injuries. Thompson tore his ACL while Durant tore his Achilles tendon, paving the way for the Raptors to win the Finals in 6 games. The tragedy that happened to this team was as though the basketball gods were saying the time of the Warriors’ dominance was over. In the offseason, the departures of Durant and a few other key members of the team signalled the end of the Warriors dynasty as we know it. Durant and Thompson spent the entirety of the 2019-2020 season recovering from their injuries. As if the Warriors franchise didn’t feel enough pain, Curry broke his wrist four games into the season, ending his season as well. It was a tough year for the Warriors. Green was unable to carry the entire load by himself seeing that he’s not a player meant to score for the Warriors, so he spent the majority of the season resting as well. </p>
	<p>Although it was a horrendous season, it meant that the Warriors are getting a high draft pick in the 2020 draft. The Warriors ended up getting the second pick which they used on center, James Wiseman. There are high hopes for him when he gets to play with Curry, Thompson, and Green in the following season. Along with the return of the trio, the Warriors having spent the 2019-2020 season training new key members, should mean a slightly more competitive season in 2020-2021. Although there was a lot of excitement of what could have been, Thompson suffered a torn Achilles tendon weeks away from the start of the 2020-2021 season. For now, the Warriors will have to compete with a rejuvenated Curry and Green who are looking to remind everyone just how good they are after a season missing in action. </p>
	<p>The legacy that was left behind from this team is truly inspirational. Aside from Durant, the core players were home grown players, contrary to many teams nowadays bringing in superstars from other teams to win games. Curry and Thompson will, without a doubt, end their careers being known as the greatest shooting duo in the history of the game. Green showed that even someone from the second round of the draft can prove to be as valuable as any other player. He was a testament to the idea that you can still outplay big centers without having the physical body as big as theirs. The memory of this dynasty will forever live in the top 5 greatest teams in the history of the NBA. </p>
